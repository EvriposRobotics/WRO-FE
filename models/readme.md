This is the 3D model of our vehicle.
Objects in orange color are the microcontrollers-sensors-motors that must be placed on the 3D printed model. We 3D printed our model using PLA plastic.
At the back axle we used an old RC car motor-differential-case system as the driving motor, so we designed a special mount for our case.

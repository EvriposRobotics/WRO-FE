**3D model of our vehicle**

For the 3D model of the robotic vehicle our team designed we provide a Tinkercad link:

All the 3d design has been made using the online 3D modelling tool www.tinkercad.com.

Parts shown in orange color represent the various electronic and electric devices used for the robot, so they are not need to be printed. Also the lego axles and bushes used for the wheels mounting are shown in orange color and they are not need to be printed. Everything else shown in different colors should be 3D printed. Parts fixation has been made using mostly m3 and some m2 bolts. The m2 bolts are used only for the parts that are mounted the upper plastic surface like the camera,the SBC and the SBM fixation, the prototype board etc. Some parts do not need bolts to fit together as they designed for press fitting (for example, the wheels with the lego axles).

PLA plastic seems to be sturdy enough for the 3D printing of the parts and there is no need for other more sophisticated and difficult to 3D print plastic types.
